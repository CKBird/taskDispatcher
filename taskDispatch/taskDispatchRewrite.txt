Task Dispatcher Breakdown
Creates queue of work to be performed then goes through that queue and invokes routine to perform work
Ready, Dead, and Completed Queue

1: Read in set of requests to be performed
2: Populate ready queue with them
3: Serially dispatch one task at a time in priority order
4: Priority or iteration count of 0 are DOA
5: Place task back on ready queue once completed if iteration > 0, or on completed if iteration = 0
6: Execution ends when ready queue is empty

Each element will be a data area, called a TCB
TCB represents one unit of work or request to be done
Each TCB never exists on more than one queue
Memory for each is acquired dynamically as needed
Memory is explicitly released or freed at end of all processing

Populate Ready Queue;
3 Values per TCB: RequestType, Iteration, Priority
RequestType is string (function; DISPLAY, ADD, SUBTRACT, DONE)
Iteration is integer from 0 - 255, 0 is never
Priority is integer from 0 - 255 where 0 means do not dispatch 1 is highest

Enqueue newly read TCB onto queue

TCB Contents:
Forward Pointer
Backward Pointer
Priority of Task
Routine to be Invoked
Iteration count
Date/time of ready enqueue
space for ready dequeue date/time

Dispatcher decodes the code and figures out which  function to run
TABLE IS USED to map each function to its string equivalent
Address of function that performs the work (pointer to function)
Priority order
DONE TCB Request Type means no more data to read in
Enqueueing of work must be task-agnostic

Dispatch all work once DONE received
1: Dequeue first TCB off ready and fill date/time of dequeue
1b: if Iteration == 0 -> enqueue to dead
1c: if Priority == 0 -> enqueue to dead
2: Invoke function that supports the task
3: Generate random priority for subsuquent runs of same process (determined at completion time)
4: Ready queue == empty, return

Function types:
1: DISPLAY randomly select famous quote and display to the screen
2: ADD generates two integers, adds them, and sends the 3 values to output with operators
3: SUBTRACT same as above

Generate report showing order the TCBs on each of the 3 queues and their contents
